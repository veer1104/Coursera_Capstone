    "\n",
    "Toronto is one of the most populous Canadian cities and is home to a large number of immigrants. As a result of this, it has diverse neighborhoods such as Greektown, Koreatown, Little Italy, and Little India. More than half of Indian immigrants in Canada reside in Toronto, and therefore there is a great demand for Indian food. \n",
    "Due to the this, starting an Indian restaurant can potentially be a great idea given that it will be profitable to the owner. Through the course of this capstone project, we will evaluate the business idea of opening an Indian restaurant. Through geospatial data analysis, we can analyze the neighborhoods in Toronto by looking at current data about the success of restaurants.\n"
